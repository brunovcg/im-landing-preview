        Questions: {
          Answer1:
            'Sorry...this isn`t a "get rich quick" opportunity. We believe that a systematic approach to operating your business, years of hard work, and dedication over many years is the way to be successful in real estate investing. We don`t believe in "getting rich quick", unicorns or leprechauns.',
          Answer2:
            ' If you`re seriously interested in joining, and are an experienced real estate investor, please Apply to the program and schedule a call with our team to discuss further. We do limit the number of members allowed in each market.',
          Answer3:
            'We consider ourselves 1/3 Life Changing Data/Technology, 1/3 Done-For-You lead generation agency, and 1/3 strategic partners to help you hit your goals. It`s a recipe we`re sure you`ll love!',
          Answer4:
            'No. We ask for a one year commitment, but if it`s not the right fit for you and you`re in good standing, we would never try to entrap you. We have to earn your business back every single month.  Our goal is to become so valuable to you that you never want to leave! However, results generally don`t happen overnight, and your data set only improves with time...we`re committed, and ask you to be as well.',
          Answer5:
            'We hope you never leave, but the burden is on us to add that much value to your life. You own your leads. In fact, we generally don`t even have access to your leads that are generated from advertising efforts.',
          Answer6:
            'Generally, yes.  We`re looking for long term members, and experienced investors understand the importance of investing in themselves and into lead generation, as well as those that are playing the "long game", and know that it takes time to optimize Results.',
